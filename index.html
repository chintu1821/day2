    <h1 align="center">Visual Studio Code</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is an integrated development environment developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS, and web browsers. Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.

        On November 18, 2015, the project "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS"), on which Visual Studio Code is based, was released under the open-source MIT License and made available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced. On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the web.

        <ul>
            <li>IntelliSense:
                VSCode goes beyond the usual syntax highlighting and offers IntelliSense, i.e. smart completions tailored to the code and its intricacies.</li>
<li>Run and Debug:
    VSCode allows you to run your code (with or without debugging it with the help of a web editor) in the app itself.</li>
    <li>Built-in Git:
        Working with Git is made easier in VSCode which allows you to make commits, stage files, and other Git actions right from the editor.
        
        Extension:</li>
        <h1 align="center">Extensions</h1>
        Extensions in VSCode add extra functionality to the editor, improving the development experience by providing tools, code snippets, themes, linters, debuggers, and more. Extensions can be installed directly from the VSCode marketplace
